ActiveX Demo for Sensoray Model 626
-----------------------------------

This directory contains a VB6 project which, in conjunction with the S626.OCX ActiveX control,
shows how to program most of the hardware functions on a 626 board.  The ActiveX control is
fundamentally a wrapper for S626.DLL.

S626.OCX requires the MFC runtime library to be installed on your system.  If it is not already
installed, you can download it from Microsoft's web site.

In order to run this project, you must have previously installed a 626 board in your system per
the instructions given in the 626 Driver manual.
