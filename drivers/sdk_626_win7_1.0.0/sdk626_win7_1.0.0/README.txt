The 626 package for Win7 is for customers upgrading to Win7.  For new applications, please consider the 826.

The Win7 626 package includes 64bit drivers and 32 bit drivers.  It includes a 32 bit DLL for use with 32 bit applications on either Windows 7-64bit or Windows 7-32 bit.

32 bit applications can be run on 64 bit Win7 with the 64 bit driver.

64 bit applications are not supported.  If 64 bit applications are required, the user is referred to the 826.

Users are advised to stay with 32 bit applications when upgrading to Windows 7 (32bit OR 64 bit).  This will result in NO loss of functionality.  32 bit applications will not run any slower, and most 626 applications do not require the extra memory space of a 64 bit application.



To install the driver, run DPINSTALL in the driver directory (32 bit or 64 bit depending on your OS).
