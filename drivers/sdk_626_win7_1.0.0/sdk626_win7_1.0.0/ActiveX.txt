ActiveX Demo for Sensoray Model 626
-----------------------------------

The VB ActiveX Demo directory contains a VB6 project which, in conjunction with the S626.OCX
ActiveX control, shows how to program most of the hardware functions on a 626 board.  Help
files are not supplied with the ActiveX control, but its functionality is similar to that of
S626.DLL; the 626 Driver manual, along with the VB6 ActiveX demo source code, should provide
sufficient information for developers of custom applications that use S626.OCX.

S626.OCX requires the MFC runtime library to be installed on your system.  If it is not already
installed, you can download it from Microsoft's web site.

In order to run this project, you must have previously installed a 626 board in your system per
the instructions given in the 626 Driver manual.
