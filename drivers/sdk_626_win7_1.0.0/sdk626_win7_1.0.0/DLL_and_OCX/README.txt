This DLL and OCX are 32 bit.  They can be used on 64 bit windows with 32 bit applications or on 32 bit windows.


Sensoray does not provide a 64bit DLL for this legacy product.  Sensoray only provides a driver useable on 64bit Windows with the 32 bit DLL.

Users are advised to stay with 32 bit applications when upgrading to Windows 7 (32bit OR 64 bit).  This will result in NO loss of functionality.  32 bit applications will not run any slower and most 626 applications do not require the extra memory space of a 64 bit application.
